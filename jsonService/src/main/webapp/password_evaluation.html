<h1>How Does Passfault Work?</h1>
<h2>Password Patterns:</h2>
<p>
Passfault identifies patterns in a password, then calculates the number of passwords 
that could exist in those patterns.  This is the measurement of password complexity.  
It is more academic and much more accurate than existing password analysis tools.
</p>

<h2>How do you make your passwords?:</h2>
<p>
Suppose a hacker knew how you made your passwords.  Would that extra knowledge help crack your 
password? Suppose you picked the first letter of every word from a long sentence.  Suppose you 
have a 35 character password build this way.  This would take decades to crack, but Facebook ranks 
it as "weak".  Why?  Because it doesn't have numbers or special characters. However if you pick 
a common word and append an a number and special character: "cracked1!", facebook ranks the 
password as strong.  This pattern could be cracked in less than one day on an average computer.      
</p>

<h2>Time to crack:</h2>
<p>
The size of a password pattern determines how many passwords a hacker would have to try to guess your
password.  To put metric in perspective, passfault will estimate the "time to crack". (Calculated by 
pattern size, type of password protection, and an estimate of cracking hardware).  The power of this 
measurement comes from it's simplicity. It is easy to understand. It communicates clearly the risk that 
a password poses to the individual and an organization.
