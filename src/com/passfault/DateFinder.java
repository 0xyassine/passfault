/**
 * No, this is not a dating service.  It is a PatternFinder for numbers in date format
 * like 12-25-'76,  MMDDYY DDMMYY, etc
 *
 * is a date really worth finding?
 * 6 random numbers: 482934 has 10 chars possible in the pattern = 10^6 = 1,000,000
 * date number: 122576 has 12 chars * 31 chars * 100 chars = 37,200
 * Maybe, maybe not, but it isn't hard to code, and doesn't take much processing, so why not.
